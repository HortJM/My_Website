                <p id="about_me">I'm Joshua Horton. I have earned a BA in Political Science. After that, I taught English as
                    a second or other language in Russia for nine months. I followed that up with seven years teaching
                    English in China. I am now working on a career change and a degree in Computer Information Systems I am also putting together notes about some of my experiences to possibly write a book on it in the future.</p>
